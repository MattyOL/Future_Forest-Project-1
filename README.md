# Colour Scheme
I used rgbacolorpicker.com to choose a color that would be easily readable and visually appealing to users , suitable for the overall look of the site.



# Typography

I used Google Fonts to select and import the fonts that were used on the site.



# Logo and Navigation Bar
The logo and navigation bar is located across all pages ,The navigation menu brings you to the correct page when clicked, too return back to home-page you can also click the logo across all pages. The logo has a hoover effect for making it easier for the user to understand that its clickable, Too make the website more responsive on the navigation on smaller mobile devices i used w3shools to make the hover effect and used code to help with this.



# The Main video of home-page
The home-page video is only located on the landing page when the user first enters the site. 



# The Footer

The footer displays across every page of the site and displays social media icons with links to the corresponding social media website to allow the user to fully explore all platforms easily i took this idea from the love runnning project with some slight changes to suit my site.


# Homepage
This is the landing page that the user will be brought to when first entering the site.
